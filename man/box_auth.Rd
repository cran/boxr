\description{
\code{box_auth} serves two purposes:
  \enumerate{
    \item Setting up box.com accounts with \code{boxr} for the first time
    \item Connecting to previously used box.com accounts
  }

In either case, it should be sufficient to run \code{box_auth()} with no
parameters. If you've authenticated with boxr before, this should be all that
is required. However, the first time you use boxr, the process is slightly
more involved (see 'Getting Set-Up' below).
}
\section{Getting Set-Up}{

\describe{

  A version of this guide is in the pakcage vignette, with some additional
  screenshots. To view the vignette, run \code{vignette("boxr")}.

  To use boxr for the first time, you need to enable API access for your
  box.com account. The process is slightly annoying. You only need to do it
  once - it takes around 2 minutes.

  The next time you use boxr, you should be able to just run
  \code{box_auth()} (without entering anything else) to be authenticated and
  ready-to-go.

  \item{\bold{1. 'Create an app'}}{
    At \url{https://www.box.com/developers}, click on 'My Apps', in the top
    right hand corner log in and create a new 'app' for your box.com account.
    This won't create an app of any description; you'll simply be granting
    yourself programmatic access to your files. You can call it anything you
    like.
  }
  \item{\bold{2. Set OAuth2 Parameters}}{
    On the next screen, you'll want to check the box for \bold{Content API
    Access Only}, and enter \code{http://localhost} as your
    \bold{redirect_uri}.
  }
  \item{\bold{3. Connect boxr to your account}}{
    Run \code{box_auth()} and pass your \code{client_id} and
    \code{client_secret} to the console when prompted. These strings are not'
    enough for someone to access your account maliciously. However, it's
    still a good idea to keep them safe, and out of any files or code which
    might be shared with others.
  }
}

A browser window should open, for you to formally grant yourself access to
your files at box.com.

From this point on, simply running \code{box_auth()} at the start of a
session should be all that is required.
