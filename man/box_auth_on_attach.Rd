\strong{This function is deprecated, and may be removed at the next release.}

This function saves you the effort of typing \code{\link[=box_auth]{box_auth()}} after
the package loads. Executing \code{box_auth_on_attach(TRUE)} will mean that
\code{boxr} will automatically attempt to authorize itself when
'attached' (e.g. \code{library(boxr)}), using the credentials from the
current session.

\note{
This is provided for convenience, but it's a bad idea to use, if:
\itemize{
\item You'd like your code to be reproducible. Even if your
collaborators have access to the same files on box.com, as the default
behaviour is to require using \code{\link[=box_auth]{box_auth()}}, code is likely to
become irreproducible.
\item You use more than one box.com account. Things could get
rather confusing.
